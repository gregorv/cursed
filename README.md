cursed
===

A [Rouge-like][1] Game written in Python.

How to run it?
===

You can either download and run the sources yourself or play via telnet.

*   To play localy, run the *cursed.py* in terminal, Python2 is required. There is
    Python 3 branch, because originaly py3 was used, but for py2 performs alot fasterâ€¦

*   If you just want to play and don't want to fetch the sources all the time,
    you can connect to the Cursed server via telnet

        telnet cursed.dynamic-noise.net
        
    You can then register a new user account and play the most recent version of
    Cursed online. The advantages of playing online is, that savegames will be
    stored there (as soon as they are implemented), so that you have your latest
    game everywhere you can access the internet. In addition to that, you can
    watch games of other players and have your own games being watched.

Note this game is still in *early* development so currently only some feature are finished.
